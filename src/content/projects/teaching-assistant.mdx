title: "Teaching Assistant Agent"
---

## Overview

An intelligent teaching assistant that adapts to individual student learning patterns, using a full fine-tuning lifecycle: SFT, RLHF, PEFT, QLoRA, and GRPO.

## Approach

### Training Pipeline
1. **SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)**: Initial training on curated teaching dialogues
2. **PEFT/QLoRA**: Parameter-efficient adaptation enabling training on consumer hardware
3. **RLHF**: Reward model trained on human preferences for teaching quality
4. **GRPO**: Group-level policy optimization for efficient alignment

### Adaptive Features
- **Questioning Strategies**: Adjusts difficulty and question style based on student performance
- **Personalized Feedback**: Generates explanations calibrated to the student's demonstrated understanding
- **Progress Tracking**: Maintains a model of each student's knowledge state

## Technical Details

The system demonstrates the full LLM alignment lifecycle from pre-training adaptation through RLHF, using efficient techniques (PEFT, QLoRA) to make the entire pipeline tractable on limited compute.
