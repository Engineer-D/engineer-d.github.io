title: "Transaction Rule Validation Agent — Adhere"
---

## Overview

Built at Adhere (a SmartComply subsidiary), this is a multi-agent system that validates whether transactions comply with business-defined rules in real-time. The system consists of two specialized agents — a SQL Agent and a Python Agent — that generate and execute validation code inside isolated containers.

## Architecture

### The Multi-Agent System

The Transaction Rule Validation Agent operates as a coordinator over two specialized agents:

**SQL Agent** — Generates SQL queries to validate transactions against rule conditions stored in databases. Given a business rule (e.g., "transactions above $10,000 require manager approval"), the agent produces the appropriate SQL to check compliance.

**Python Agent** — Generates Python code for complex rule validations that go beyond what SQL can express — multi-step logic, conditional chains, cross-referencing external data, and custom business logic.

### Isolated Execution

Both agents generate code that runs inside **isolated containers**, ensuring:
- Security: generated code cannot access production systems
- Reliability: failures in validation don't affect transaction processing
- Auditability: every generated code snippet is logged for compliance review

### Real-Time Processing

The entire pipeline — rule interpretation, code generation, execution, and result — completes in **sub-2-second latency**, enabling validation during live transaction processing without blocking the payment flow.

## How It Works

1. A transaction enters the processing pipeline
2. The system identifies which business rules apply
3. The SQL and Python agents generate validation code specific to the transaction and rules
4. Code executes in sandboxed containers
5. Results determine whether the transaction passes or requires escalation

## Impact

This system enables businesses to define compliance rules in natural language and have them automatically enforced on every transaction — no manual coding required for new rules.
