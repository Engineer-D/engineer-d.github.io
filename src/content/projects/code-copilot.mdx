title: "Code Copilot for Dart"
---

## Overview

A fine-tuned LLM specialized for code assistance in the Dart programming language, demonstrating domain-specific model adaptation for underserved programming languages.

## Approach

- Fine-tuned a base language model on Dart-specific code corpora
- Focused on code completion, explanation, and bug detection
- Evaluated on Dart-specific coding tasks and benchmarks

## Motivation

While code assistants work well for popular languages (Python, JavaScript), less common but important languages like Dart (used in Flutter) receive less attention. This project explored whether targeted fine-tuning could close that gap.

## Key Takeaway

Domain-specific fine-tuning on a focused corpus can significantly improve code assistance quality for niche languages, even with relatively small training datasets.
