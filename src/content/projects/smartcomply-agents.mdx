title: "Production AI Agents — SmartComply"
---

## Overview

At SmartComply (now Seequre), I architected and deployed 6 production LLM-powered agents serving as the AI backbone of a cybersecurity compliance platform. These agents handle real-world compliance workflows for organizations navigating PCI DSS 4.0, NDPR, ISO 27001, and SOC 2 standards.

## The Agents

### 1. Code Scanner Agent
Automated vulnerability detection across code repositories, identifying security risks and generating actionable remediation recommendations aligned with compliance frameworks.

### 2. Risk Assessment Agent
Evaluates organizational risk posture by analyzing infrastructure configurations, access controls, and operational procedures against compliance benchmarks.

### 3. Document Review Agent
Verifies compliance documentation against PCI DSS 4.0, NDPR, ISO, and SOC standards — parsing, cross-referencing, and flagging gaps in policy documents.

### 4. Questionnaire Answering Agent
Handles compliance questionnaires by understanding context, retrieving relevant organizational data, and generating accurate, evidence-backed responses.

### 5. Customer Support Agent
Multi-tool cybersecurity support agent with advanced dialogue management, handling technical compliance queries with context-aware responses.

### 6. QA Agent
Privacy-preserving compliance assessments with PII masking, ensuring sensitive data is protected during automated quality assurance workflows.

## Technical Architecture

- **LLM orchestration** with multi-tool calling and structured outputs
- **RAG pipelines** for grounding responses in organizational documents
- **PII masking** for privacy-preserving data handling
- **Multi-turn dialogue management** for complex compliance conversations
- **Production deployment** serving live compliance workflows

## Impact

These agents power the core compliance automation at SmartComply, reducing manual review time and enabling organizations to maintain continuous compliance posture.
