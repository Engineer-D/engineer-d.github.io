title: "Eusate — AI Customer Support Platform"
---

## Overview

Eusate is an AI-first customer support platform I founded, designed specifically for the African market. It uses RAG architecture to deliver culturally-aware, multilingual responses while reducing hallucinations by 78%.

## Problem

Customer support in Africa faces unique challenges: multiple languages, cultural context that global AI models miss, and businesses that need affordable AI solutions without sacrificing quality.

## Solution

### RAG Architecture
- Company-specific knowledge bases indexed for fast retrieval
- Grounded responses that cite actual documentation and policies
- 78% reduction in hallucinations compared to standard LLM approaches

### Cultural Awareness
- Multilingual support with culturally-appropriate communication styles
- Understanding of local business contexts and customer expectations

### Scale
- Scalable infrastructure supporting thousands of concurrent conversations
- Sub-second response latency for real-time chat
- Integrated sentiment analysis for empathetic responses

## Status

Eusate is an active startup, continuing to grow its customer base across Africa.
