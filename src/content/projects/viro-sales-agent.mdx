## Architecture

VIRO demonstrates agentic AI at its most autonomous — combining real-time speech processing, tool use, long-term memory, and proactive planning in a single system that operates with minimal human oversight.

## Research Context

This project explored the boundaries of autonomous agent operation in high-stakes business contexts, informing research on agent safety, reliability, and human-AI handoff protocols.
