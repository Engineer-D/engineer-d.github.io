title: "BlindHelp — Assistive AI System"
---

## Overview

An embedded AI system designed for visually impaired individuals, combining real-time face detection, recognition, and audio feedback — all deployed on a Raspberry Pi.

## How It Works

1. **Face Detection**: Camera captures the scene and detects faces in real-time
2. **Face Recognition**: Matches detected faces against a registered database of known individuals
3. **Audio Feedback**: Announces recognized individuals through speakers, helping the user identify people around them

## Technical Details

- Real-time face detection and recognition pipeline
- Optimized for Raspberry Pi's limited compute
- Audio synthesis for natural spoken feedback
- Expandable face database for registering new individuals

## Impact

This project demonstrates how AI can be deployed on affordable edge devices to meaningfully improve quality of life for people with visual impairments, without requiring cloud connectivity or expensive hardware.
