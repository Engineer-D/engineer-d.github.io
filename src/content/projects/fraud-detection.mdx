title: "Real-Time Fraud Detection — Adhere"
---

## Overview

Built at Adhere (a SmartComply subsidiary), this fraud detection system combines supervised and unsupervised machine learning models for live transaction monitoring, catching both known fraud patterns and novel zero-day attacks.

## Approach

### Supervised Models
ML classifiers trained on labeled fraud/legitimate transaction data to recognize known fraud patterns — account takeover, card testing, transaction velocity abuse, and other established fraud vectors.

### Unsupervised Models
Anomaly detection models that identify unusual transaction patterns without relying on labeled data. These catch novel fraud strategies that haven't been seen before — the zero-day attacks of the financial world.

### Combined Strategy
By running both supervised and unsupervised models in parallel, the system achieves high recall on known patterns while maintaining the ability to flag genuinely new threats.

## Performance

- Real-time scoring during live transaction processing
- Combined approach catches both known and novel fraud patterns
- Integrated with the broader Adhere transaction monitoring pipeline
