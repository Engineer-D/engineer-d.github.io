title: "Real-Time Fraud Detection System"
---

## Overview

Built at Adhere (by SmartComply), this system combines a transaction rule validation agent with supervised and unsupervised fraud detection models, all operating at sub-2-second latency during live transaction processing.

## Components

### Rule Generation Agent
An LLM-powered agent that generates Python and SQL validation code in real-time during transaction processing. Given a set of business rules, it produces executable validation logic on the fly.

### Supervised Models
Traditional ML classifiers trained on labeled fraud/legitimate transaction data for known fraud patterns.

### Unsupervised Models
Anomaly detection for identifying novel fraud patterns not seen in training data — catching zero-day fraud attacks.

## Performance

- **Sub-2-second latency** for end-to-end transaction validation
- Real-time code generation and execution during live processing
- Combined supervised + unsupervised approach catches both known and novel fraud patterns
