title: "AI Farm Intrusion Detection"
---

## Overview

An edge-deployed computer vision system for detecting farm intrusions, using a lightweight Faster R-CNN with MobileNet backbone. Achieves 97-99% accuracy while running on ESP32 cameras and Raspberry Pi hardware.

## Architecture

### Model
- **Faster R-CNN** with **MobileNet** backbone — optimized for edge deployment
- Model compression and quantization for embedded hardware constraints
- 97-99% detection accuracy maintained after optimization

### Hardware
- **ESP32** cameras for image capture
- **Raspberry Pi** for on-device inference
- Low-power operation suitable for remote farm locations

### System
- Real-time detection and alerting
- Works offline without cloud connectivity
- Designed for harsh environmental conditions

## Motivation

Small-scale farmers in Nigeria face significant losses from animal and human intrusions. This system provides affordable, automated surveillance using commodity hardware.
